    DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

 

Current Products:

 

Digital Merchant Gift Cards. Recipients of digital gift cards will receive a  link or code in their e-mail to retrieve their activated electronic Merchant Gift Cards.

 

Physical Merchant Gift Cards. Physical Merchant Gift Cards will either (i) be delivered to you via mail, or (ii) be printable from an electronic message sent to you.

 

Prepaid Cards are those products that contain stored value that can be used anywhere, without restriction to a specific retailer or website, such as VISA and MasterCard. You may be required to register with a third party (the company that supplies the prepaid card) in order to use the stored value and to enable the third party supplier to comply with certain financial and banking regulations. Tango Card has no control over or involvement with these matters.

 

Reward Link™ and PromoLink™.  Each of these products represent a stored value with instructions that takes a Recipient to a landing page where the Recipient can select from a custom catalog of Rewards. The PromoLink has a stated date of expiration for use by a Recipient.  Both the Reward LinkTM and Promo Link TM may be sent by email or by mail.

 

Donation to Non-Profit Organizations: Your Reward may include the option to donate some or all of your Reward to select non-profit organization(s). Donations of Reward value are subject to the following terms and conditions: (i) donations are transferred from Tango Card to non-profit organizations promptly, in accordance with our agreements with the non-profit organizations, (ii) the entire amount of a donation may be tax deductible for the donor, however, a small administrative fee is recognized by the non-profit organization and retained by Tango Card in connection with each donation.

 

Legacy Product:

 

TANGO CARD. A “TANGO CARD” is not a Merchant Gift Card; it is a voucher containing value that may be used at the tangocard.com Site to: (i) obtain Merchant Gift Card(s) or other digital products made available to you for selection and/or (ii) used to donate U.S. Dollars via our website to designated non-profit organizations. A TANGO CARD itself cannot be used at merchant stores and has value only through usage at the Site. This Product is no longer available in new programs, however, if you hold a previously issued TANGO CARD you are still eligible to redeem it.

    GENERAL

 

For purposes of these TOS, “you” and “your” shall mean you, and “we”, “us,” and “our” means Tango Card and, if applicable, those third parties acting on behalf of Tango Card from time to time. We may assign our rights and responsibilities hereunder without notice to you. The TOS constitutes the entire understanding between you and Tango Card concerning your use of the Service. The CTOS and the relationship between you and Tango Card shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within King County, Washington. Class Action Waiver. Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor Tango Card will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. Any claim arising out of, relating to, or concerning any interpretation, construction, performance, or breach of this Agreement, will be settled by arbitration to be held in King County, Washington, in accordance with the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator may grant injunctions or other relief in the dispute or controversy. The decision of the arbitrator will be final, conclusive, and binding on the parties to the arbitration. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s decision in any court having jurisdiction. You and Tango Card will each pay one half of the costs and expenses of the arbitration, and each will separately pay their own counsel fees and expenses. No arbitration or other proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.

The failure of Tango Card to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect. The section titles in the TOS are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
