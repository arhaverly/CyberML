Last Updated September 1, 2020

These Terms of Use (these “Terms of Use”) govern your Use (as defined below) of the websites offered by Western Digital Technologies, Inc. and/or its affiliates (collectively, “Western Digital,” “we,” or “our”) and the content, features, materials, software and related documentation, and services available on such websites (such websites, content, features, materials, software and related documentation, and services, collectively, the “Services”).

IMPORTANT – PLEASE READ CAREFULLY – If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, then you are not authorized to Use the Services.

To help you navigate and find specific sections of these Terms of Use, please refer to this table of contents below:
Acceptance of These Terms of Use

By Using (as defined below) the Services: you represent and warrant that you are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction and have all power, authority, and permissions necessary to enter into and be bound by these Terms of Use; you acknowledge that you have read and understood, and agree to be bound by, these Terms of Use; and you agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in connection with your Use of the Services.

If you Use the Services on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then:  “you” includes you and that entity; you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms of Use and that you agree to these Terms of Use on the entity’s behalf; and you agree that such entity is legally and financially responsible for your Use of the Services as well as for the use of your User Account (as defined below) by others affiliated with your entity, including any employees, agents, or contractors
Interpretation

For purposes of these Terms of Use: the capitalized verb “Use” means to access, browse, create a User Account (as defined below) on, upload content or material to, download content or material from, or otherwise use the Services (and the noun “Use” and term “Using” will have corollary meanings); the terms “you” and “your” refer to you as a user who Uses the Services; and all references to the words “includes,” “included,” or “including” are deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”
Changes to These Terms of Use

WE MAY, AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION, CHANGE THESE TERMS OF USE AT ANY TIME BY UPDATING THIS PAGE.  IF YOU CONTINUE TO USE THE SERVICES AFTER ANY SUCH CHANGE, THEN YOU ARE BOUND BY SUCH CHANGE.  THEREFORE, YOU SHOULD VISIT THIS PAGE PERIODICALLY TO REVIEW THESE TERMS OF USE.  IF ANY CHANGE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO YOU, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO CONTINUE USING THE SERVICES.
Additional Terms

We offer a broad range of products and services, including software products and services.  Some products or services available on our websites may be subject to other or additional terms and conditions (“Additional Terms”).  Those Additional Terms will be made available with the relevant products or services, such as by being posted directly on the website of those products or services or being presented as a separate set of terms and conditions at the time of purchase, download, access, browsing, or use of those products or services.  To the extent these Terms of Use apply to those products or services (e.g., because they are made available on our websites) but are inconsistent with the Additional Terms applicable to those products or services, those Additional Terms will supersede any inconsistent provisions in these Terms of Use and will control with respect to those products or services.
