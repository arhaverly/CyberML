THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION IN SECTION 18. TO THE EXTENT IT APPLIES, THIS PROVISION REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIAL OR CLASS ACTIONS.

The Services are licensed, not sold, to You for use only under the terms of this Agreement, unless the Services are accompanied by a separate license agreement, in which case the terms of that separate license agreement will govern, subject to Your prior acceptance of that separate license agreement.
