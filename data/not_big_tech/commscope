and reliability.
Some of the information provided by CommScope on the Site and the CommScope Social

financial performance of CommScope that constitute “forward-looking statements” within
meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995 and other related laws that provide a “safe harbor” for forward-looking statements. Theseforward-looking statements, which may include statements that reflect our current views with
respect to future events and financial performance, are identified by their use of such terms and
phrases as “intend,” “goal,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “projections,” “plans,” “anticipate,”
“should,” “designed to,” “foreseeable future,” “believe,” “confident,” “think,” “scheduled,”
“outlook,” “guidance” and similar expressions. This list of indicative terms and phrases is not
intended to be all-inclusive. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-
looking statements, which speak only as of the date they were made. We are not undertaking any
duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect developments or
information obtained after the date such forward-looking statements are made.
Our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in forward-looking
statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (a) the
general economic, political and competitive conditions in the markets where we operate;
(b) changes in capital availability or costs, such as changes in interest rates, security ratings and
market perceptions of the businesses in which we operate; (c) changes in the regulatory
framework governing business generally, and the telecommunication services and equipment
industry in particular, in the U.S. and other countries; (d) changes in authoritative generally
accepted accounting principles or policies from such standard-setting bodies as the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); (e) the impact of corporate governance, accounting
and securities law reforms by the United States Congress, the SEC or the New York Stock
Exchange; (f) natural and man-made catastrophes; and (g) other factors discussed in the
documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including specifically our most recently filed
reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, as amended, to which we refer you for more information

User Generated Content
You may submit content, including text, images, photographs and video to the CommScope
Social Networks (collectively, “User Generated Content”), provided that you abide by these
common sense rules:
•
If you post it, you own it
Think twice before you publish. Would you want your family, friends, colleagues, or
others to read or see the content you post? Keep in mind that even if original content
2can be deleted, the content that is shared and distributed through an array of channels
can be reposted, searched, and found on the Internet.
•
Respect the law, including with regard to intellectual property
It is critical that you show proper respect for the law generally, and specifically for
the laws governing copyright and fair use of copyrighted material. You should not
quote more than short excerpts from someone else’s work. It is good general practice
to link to others’ work. Use appropriate symbols to mark the first appearance of
trademarked terms in your content. Do not post images, music or other copyrighted
content unless you own them or have permission from the owner to display such
content in this context. Keep in mind that the laws may differ depending on where
you live.
•
Treat others like you want to be treated
Be respectful of others’ opinions and beliefs. Use common courtesy when posting
content: refrain from abusive, obscene, or offensive language, images, or links. Do
not post content from, or links to, Internet sites that feature sexual content, gambling,
or that advocate intolerance of others; and do not create such content on
CommScope’s Social Networks.
•
Do not post confidential or proprietary information
By posting content to CommScope’s Social Networks, you are agreeing to allow
anyone with access to CommScope’s Social Networks to access it and use it without
restriction, except with regard to any applicable intellectual property rights that you
