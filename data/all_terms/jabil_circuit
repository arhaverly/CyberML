MANUFACTURING SERVICES AGREEMENT

This MANUFACTURING SERVICES AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made this 30th day of May, 2007 (“Effective Date”) by and between JABIL CIRCUIT, INC., a Delaware corporation, having a principal place of business at 10560 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Street, North St. Petersburg, Florida 33716, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (“Manufacturer”), and ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION, having a principal place of business at 333 Corporate Woods Parkway, Vernon Hills, Illinois 60061 (“Zebra”). Zebra and Manufacturer are, collectively, referred to herein as the “parties,” or individually as a “party.”

A. WHEREAS, Zebra is in the business of designing, developing, manufacturing, distributing, marketing and selling printers, including thermal bar code label and receipt printers, card printers, photo quality thermal dye transfer printers, RFID smart label printers/encoders, label design and integration software, supplies, accessories and certain related products;

B. WHEREAS, Manufacturer is in the business of providing comprehensive design, development, manufacturing, testing, configuring, assembling, packaging, shipping and product management services of electronics components, assemblies and systems;

C. WHEREAS, Zebra desires to purchase certain products from Manufacturer, including PCBAs and Box Builds, and Manufacturer desires to manufacture and sell such products to Zebra, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

D. WHEREAS, Zebra may, from time to time, desire Manufacturer to provide engineering, design or other services related to products under this Agreement, which services will be addressed as set forth in Section 2.1.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of foregoing and the other promises and mutual covenants set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Manufacturer and Zebra hereby agree and covenant as follows.

Article I.

General Terms And Conditions

 
1.1     Definitions. Terms used herein with initial capital letters shall have the respective meanings set forth in Article X.

 
1.2     Appointment of Manufacturer. Zebra hereby appoints Manufacturer, and Manufacturer hereby accepts, the non-exclusive appointment to manufacture the Products for purchase by Zebra, at such times and from time to time as Zebra, in its sole discretion, may request by issuance of a binding forecast per Section 4.1.

 
1.3     Other Zebra Parties. If Zebra provides Manufacturer with a parental guarantee, Zebra’s Affiliates shall have the right to purchase Products in accordance with the other terms of

 
***     Confidential treatment requested pursuant to a request for confidential treatment filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Omitted portions have been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 

-8-

        

this Agreement. Any and all pricing that is offered to Zebra shall also be made available to Zebra’s Affiliates.

 
1.4     Exclusivity. Manufacturer shall not manufacture, package, market or sell any finished Product, or any WIP, component, subassembly, assembly or print engine unique to any finished Product, to or for any Person, anywhere in the world, other than to Zebra or Zebra’s Affiliates.

 
1.5     Non-competition. Manufacturer acknowledges that Zebra possesses valuable Confidential Information, Technology and Intellectual Property Rights related to the Products, that Zebra derives significant competitive advantage from the foregoing, that Manufacturer will be exposed to Zebra’s Confidential Information and Technology in connection with its obligations under this Agreement and that money damages are insufficient to protect Zebra’s interest in its Confidential Information, Technology and Intellectual Property Rights. Manufacturer further acknowledges that the scope of Zebra’s business is independent of location such that is not practical to limit the restrictions contained in this Section 1.5 to specific countries. Therefore, in order to protect Zebra’s rights in its Confidential Information, Technology and Intellectual Property Rights, and the value of Zebra’s business, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, [*** Redacted] Manufacturer acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 1.5 are reasonable in all respects, necessary to protect Zebra’s Confidential Information, Technology and Intellectual Property Rights, constitute a material inducement of Zebra to enter into this Agreement and that, without such protection, Zebra’s competitive advantage would be materially adversely affected. If, at the time of enforcement of these provisions, a court or arbitrator’s award permitted by Section 9.5a holds that the restrictions stated in this Section 1.5 are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties agree that the maximum period, scope or geographical area reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated period, scope or area.

 
1.6     Most Favored Nation. Manufacturer shall not, anywhere in the world, manufacture, package, market or sell thermal barcode printers or thermal card printers, at lower prices, or on better terms, than those offered to Zebra. If such better terms or pricing are provided to any Person, then Manufacturer shall promptly offer the same pricing or terms to Zebra. At its sole option, Zebra may elect to substitute such pricing or terms for the corresponding pricing or terms herein.

 
1.7     Competitiveness. Manufacturer understands that Zebra’s purchase of Products under this Agreement is dependent upon the Product pricing remaining competitive with that of other manufacturers and suppliers for thermal barcode printers or thermal card printers. Manufacturer shall be responsible for surveying the industry and benchmarking contract terms (including pricing, inventory levels, flexibility and lead time for Materials) and shall share all such information (including Manufacturer’s internal supply chain management report) in detail with Zebra during the Quarterly Business Review.

substantially intact until the Production Line is fully operational and qualified by both Zebra and Manufacturer.

 
3.3     Facilities.

a. Designated Facilities. Manufacturer shall manufacture the Products only at the Designated Facility and shall not change such facility, or product lines within such facility, unless by COA as provided in Section 3.12(ix). Manufacturer shall operate all facilities for Products in accordance with United States generally accepted industry standards, including with respect to environmental conditions (e.g., plumbing and electrical lines and equipment, and heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems).

b. Line Down/Stop Ship. Manufacturer shall notify Zebra promptly (but in no event longer than twenty-four (24) hours) if any defect or other problem affects a significant portion of a Product line, and Zebra shall have the right to halt the affected Production Line from producing the Products and to issue a stop ship order on all affected Products. If any such condition occurs for any reason, then Manufacturer shall provide additional resources and escalation as needed to accelerate resolution of the problem and to rework affected Product. Manufacturer shall within twenty-four (24) hours of the occurrence of such condition provide Zebra with a report setting forth the status and location of all affected Materials and Products (e.g., finished goods, WIP, etc.).

c. Business Continuity Plan. The Manufacturer’s business continuity plan for the Services and Products (“BCP”) shall be attached as Exhibit E to this Agreement. Manufacturer and Zebra shall work together in good faith to promptly resolve any objections Zebra may have with respect to any component of the BCP. If the BCP attached in Exhibit E applies to a specific Designated Facility, then the BCP for each other Designated Facility shall consist of a similar document in similar detail with the same approach to business continuity. As any new Service(s) or Product(s) is added under this Agreement, the respective BCP will be updated to include such new Service(s) or Product(s) prior to the first purchase thereof hereunder. Each BCP shall at a minimum: (i) be designed to prevent any disruption in the supply of the Services and Products, notwithstanding the occurrence of any Force Majeure event or other failure; (ii) specify procedures and frequency of BCP plan testing; (iii) specify alternate facilities (subject to Zebra’s pre-approval) and how quickly they will be activated; (iv) specify priority rights of Zebra for BCP services from Manufacturer in the event of a broad-based failure; and (v) be consistent with current United States generally accepted industry standards, and shall be maintained and updated consistent with then-current United States generally accepted industry standards. If a problem should arise within such facility, or with any such Product line, that would adversely impact Manufacturer’s ability to manufacture any of the Products for Zebra, then Manufacturer shall promptly (but in no event longer than twenty-four (24) hours) notify Zebra in detail of such problem. If Zebra’s supply of the Products is affected or may reasonably be deemed to be threatened (whether by a Force Majeure event or otherwise), Manufacturer shall promptly implement the BCP with respect to the Services and Products. The occurrence of a crisis (including any Force

-16-

Majeure event) will not relieve Manufacturer of its obligation to implement the BCP and to provide disaster recovery services. If the Services and supply of Products are not restored within the period specified in the BCP, Zebra may terminate this Agreement, subject to the same cure period as provided in Section 8.2.

 
3.4     Tooling.

a. Procurement of Unique Tooling. Manufacturer shall use any Unique Tooling specified by Zebra in writing to manufacture a Product or perform other Services for Zebra. Before beginning any work hereunder, Manufacturer shall promptly notify Zebra of (i) any Unique Tooling that Manufacturer will need to acquire or manufacture to meet Product or other Service requirements, and the cost thereof, and (ii) the cost to acquire or manufacture any Unique Tooling specified by Zebra. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of Manufacturer’s notification, Zebra shall notify Manufacturer either that (i) it is willing to incur the cost of such Unique Tooling or (ii) it is not willing to incur the cost of such Unique Tooling. If Zebra notifies Manufacturer that it is unwilling to incur such cost, then Manufacturer shall not proceed with the Services for which such Unique Tooling is required. If Zebra notifies Manufacturer that it is willing to incur the costs of such Unique Tooling, then Zebra shall also indicate whether (i) it will provide such Unique Tooling to Manufacturer, or (ii) that it will not provide such Unique Tooling, in which case Manufacturer shall acquire or manufacture such Unique Tooling and Zebra shall reimburse Manufacturer for the cost thereof as provided in Section 5.3, unless the parties agree in writing that the cost of such Unique Tooling will be included in the price of the affected Product or Service. If Manufacturer purchases Unique Tooling at Zebra’s request and Zebra chooses to include the cost of such Unique Tooling in the price of the affected Product, Zebra will reimburse Manufacturer for any costs not yet recovered through purchases where such shortfall results from Zebra’s failure to purchase the requisite quantity of affected Products or upon termination of this Agreement. To the extent that Unique Tooling must be procured from third parties, unless Zebra notifies Manufacturer that Zebra will procure such Unique Tooling, Manufacturer agrees to be responsible for handling such procurement from the third party designated by Zebra. Upon payment by Zebra for Unique Tooling or, if acquired by Zebra, upon Zebra’s request, Manufacturer shall promptly provide Zebra with the Specifications, drawings and blueprints for all Unique Tooling, whether provided by Zebra or Manufacturer.

b. Ownership and Maintenance of Tooling. Manufacturer shall own all tooling, equipment, fixtures and molds not provided or paid for, directly or indirectly, by Zebra (including all such materials included in thenon-depreciable costs for which Manufacturer is responsible pursuant to Section 3.6). Manufacturer shall at its cost take all such maintenance and repair actions as are required to ensure that all tooling, equipment, fixtures and molds used by Manufacturer for the Products and components (whether owned by Zebra or Manufacturer) are and remain capable of producing components and/or finished Products that meet the Specifications. In the event that any tool, equipment, fixture or mold used for the manufacture of the Products is damaged, lost or destroyed during the Term of this Agreement, Manufacturer shall promptly repair or

3.8     Other Materials.

a. Approved Materials and Vendors. Manufacturer shall use only the Materials specified in the Bill of Materials for a Product or Service to manufacture such Product or perform such Service and shall obtain all such Materials only from the vendor specified in the Approved Vendor List for the respective Materials. Zebra may add or remove vendors from the Approved Vendor List at any time upon notice to Manufacturer. Manufacturer may suggest the addition or removal of vendors from the Approved Vendor List at any time, but such changes to the Approved Vendor List shall only be made with Zebra’s prior approval. Manufacturer shall be responsible for qualifying new vendors for the Approved Vendor List for Materials for finished Products (but not for the finished Products themselves), according to procedures specified by Zebra in writing. Manufacturer shall provide a data package for all Materials with sufficient details for Zebra to qualify such Materials at the system level.

b. Manufacturer Direct Purchases.

 
        (i)     At Zebra’s request, Manufacturer shall purchase certain of the Materials directly from a vendor designated by Zebra on terms and conditions that are no less favorable than the terms and conditions such vendor offers to Zebra for such Materials; provided that, Zebra’s vendors permit Manufacturer to purchase under such terms and conditions. By way of example and without limitation, during the transfer of production from Zebra’s suppliers to Manufacturer, Zebra may request that Manufacturer purchase suppliers’ remaining inventory prior to ordering Materials from Manufacturer’s suppliers on the Approved Vendor List. Pricing for this Material will reflect Manufacturer’s purchase price from such supplier.

 
        (ii)    Without limiting the foregoing, Zebra may elect to assign to Manufacturer some or all of Zebra’s purchasing obligations and/or rights to purchase, as applicable, under an agreement with a vendor of Materials, and Manufacturer shall not unreasonably refuse such assignment of rights and assumption of obligations.

c. Consignments. In the event that the parties determine that consignments of Materials are necessary or desirable, the parties will negotiate in good faith the transfer of such consigned Materials, including the amount of mark-up, if any, on such consigned Materials.

d. Materials Declaration. Zebra shall notify Manufacturer, in reasonable detail, with respect to each Product on Exhibit A as of the Effective Date, whether or not the Product is exempt from Materials Declaration Requirements. For Products that have been identified in writing to Manufacturer as subject to Materials Declaration Requirements, Manufacturer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure, or assist Zebra in procuring (if applicable), Materials that are compliant with Materials Declaration

-19-

Requirements. Upon Zebra’s request, Manufacturer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect documentation from suppliers on the Approved Vendor List as of the Effective Date, certifying compliance with Materials Declaration Requirements with respect to Materials, the form of which certification has been provided, or approved, by Zebra (“Compliance Certification”). For suppliers added to the Approved Vendor List after the Effective Date, Manufacturer shall obtain such Compliance Certification as part of the supplier qualification process pursuant to Section 3.8a. Upon Zebra’s request, Manufacturer shall promptly provide copies of all requested Compliance Certifications to Zebra. In the event that any supplier does not provide Compliance Certification, Manufacturer shall promptly notify Zebra and cooperate with Zebra to remove such supplier from the Approved Vendor List or take such other action that the parties mutually agree upon in writing. In addition, Manufacturer shall fully cooperate and render all necessary assistance to Zebra in its efforts to recover on any claims against any suppliers related to Materials Declaration Requirements. In the event that a supplier fails to provide a Compliance Certification, Manufacturer has notified Zebra of such failure and Zebra has notified Manufacturer that Zebra still chooses to accept Materials from such supplier, then Manufacturer shall bear no responsibility or liability for the lack of such Compliance Certification. Zebra understands and agrees that:

 
        (i)     Zebra is responsible for notifying Manufacturer of the specific Materials Declaration Requirements and any exemptions thereto that Zebra determines to be applicable to the Product and, as between Zebra and Manufacturer, shall be solely liable for the adequacy and sufficiency of such determination of Materials Declaration Requirements;

 
        (ii)    Any information or certification regarding Materials Declaration Requirements of a Product as well as Materials used in the Product shall come from the relevant supplier (which Manufacturer shall promptly pass on to Zebra). Manufacturer does not test, certify or otherwise warrant Materials compliance, on a homogenous material level or any other level, with Materials Declaration Requirements; and

 
        (iii)   As between Zebra and Manufacturer, Zebra is ultimately and solely responsible for compliance with, Materials Declarations Requirements, including ensuring that any Materials used in the Product, as well as the Product itself, are compliant with applicable Materials Declaration Requirements, other than with respect to (A) the remedies provided for under Section 7.2b and (B) Manufacturer’s failure to perform its obligations under this Section 3.8d.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if Zebra determines that any Materials received by Manufacturer for use in Products (whether directly from the supplier or in a rejected or returned Product) do not comply with Materials Declarations Requirements, then Zebra shall be entitled to the remedies provided in Section 7.2b.

e. Inbound Inspections. Manufacturer shall perform the inspection procedures set forth in Exhibit F (the “Inspection Procedures”) on all incoming Materials and shall not use any Materials that do not pass such inspection in any of the Products. Manufacturer shall not pass on any costs related to any such Materials to Zebra. If the Inspection Procedures apply to a specific Designated Facility, then the Inspection Procedures for each other Designated Facility shall consist of a similar document in similar detail with the same approach to Materials inspection.

f. Last Buys. Within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Effective Date, Manufacturer shall provide contact information for suppliers of Materials for the Products and shall promptly provide updated details to Zebra as such information changes. If Manufacturer becomes aware that a supplier plans to discontinue any Materials (by termination or otherwise), then Manufacturer shall promptly notify Zebra and work with Zebra to place a last-buy order sufficient for Zebra’s needs, it being understood that Manufacturer shall place such order and shall keep such Materials in Manufacturer’s inventory until consumed by Zebra. Zebra shall be responsible for inventory storage costs for that portion of the last-buy inventory that exceeds Zebra’s 90-day forecasted demand in the Weekly Forecast. Such cost shall be calculated in the same manner as for storage costs for Excess Inventory pursuant to Section 4.3a. Manufacturer shall work with Zebra to transition discontinued Materials to new Materials, including by performing a form, fit and function analysis, and comparison, of such Materials.

g. Initial Transfer of Materials to Manufacturer. During the initial transfer of a Product, Manufacturer shall not apply a mark-up to the Materials provided by Zebra.

 
3.9     Long-Lead Time Materials; Minimum Order Quantities. Manufacturer and Zebra shall agree in writing on the Materials that are Long-lead Time Materials or have minimum order quantities for each Bill of Materials and each Product or Service. If during the Term, Long-Lead Time Materials or Materials with minimum order quantities are required for any Product or Service, then Manufacturer shall notify Zebra of such Materials and quantities and shall not purchase such Materials without Zebra’s prior approval. Manufacturer shall keep Zebra apprised on an ongoing basis of any changes to any such Long-lead Time Materials or minimum order quantities. It is the intent of the parties that Long-lead Time Materials and minimum order quantities shall be a topic discussed by the parties at the Quarterly Business Review.

 
3.10    Destruction of Scrap. Not later than the tenth (10th) day after the end of each calendar month, Manufacturer shall destroy all Scrap accumulated during such month and shall provide written certification of such destruction to Zebra with the inventory report required by Section 3.11. Manufacturer shall be solely responsible for the cost of all Scrap and all cost and expenses related to Scrap, including the cost of destruction.

a. Inventory Tracking. Manufacturer shall maintain the ability to trace individual Materials and Products via barcode, which barcode shall provide information necessary or useful for recalls, retrofits, field changes and root cause analysis (e.g., serial number, supplier, manufacture date, test history and repair history).

b. Inventory Reports. On a weekly basis during the Term, Manufacturer shall provide to Zebra (at Zebra’s option) reporting via online access to Manufacturer’s customer information system or in a file format meeting Zebra’s requirements a report setting forth as of the last business day of the prior week (a) clear to build for each Product, as well as all Products, (b) Materials inventory levels including those Materials identified to be used with the Products, (c) Materials on order quantities with expected delivery dates to Manufacturer, (d) WIP, (e) advanced shipping notices indicating both Materials and quantities thereof, (f) Materials details including costs and lead times, and (g) any Scrap not destroyed pursuant to Section 3.10, together with certification of the Scrap destroyed.

 
3.12    Change Orders. No change may be made to the manufacturing process or Specifications for a Product, or to the Services to be performed under an SOW, unless pursuant to a COA signed by authorized representatives of both parties. Either party may request such a change by issuing a COR substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit G, consistent with the following procedure:

 
        (i)     The party requesting the COR shall submit the COR to the other party in writing.

 
        (ii)    Zebra shall include with any COR submitted to Manufacturer sufficient documentation for the changes to enable Manufacturer to prepare a COR impact analysis as described in subsection (iv) below. Upon receipt of a COR and such documentation from Zebra, Manufacturer shall in good faith promptly (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days) perform a COR impact analysis and promptly forward it to Zebra.

 
        (iii)   Manufacturer shall include a COR impact analysis as described in subsection (iv) below with any COR submitted to Zebra.

 
        (iv)    Each COR impact analysis shall include (i) the feasibility of the changes, (ii) any update required to the Specifications to implement the COR, (iii) the actual cost of any new Unique Tooling required to implement the COR, which Unique Tooling shall be owned and maintained in accordance with Section 3.4, (iv) the effect of such changes, if any, on Manufacturer’s performance of the Services, including any anticipated changes to the delivery dates for affected Products, (v) status of affected Products, (vi) the estimated effect of such changes, if any, on the fees and NRE Costs for affected Services and/or Products, (vii) cost effect, if any, on WIP and (viii) any other information reasonably requested by Zebra.

-22-

        (v)     No COR shall be implemented until authorized representatives of each party have agreed in writing to such changes or modifications of the Products by executing a COA substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit H; provided that, Manufacturer shall not unreasonably refuse to implement such changes if Zebra has agreed to pay the NRE Costs and changes in Product pricing set forth in Manufacturer’s COR impact analysis. Each COA signed by both parties shall be deemed an amendment to this Agreement including, where applicable, the Specifications.

 
        (vi)    As requested by Zebra in writing, Manufacturer shall rework, at Zebra’s cost, all WIP and Products that are required by Zebra to be modified to the latest COA revision; provided that the corresponding COR was not initiated to correct a defect in Manufacturer’s manufacturing process and not required by the Specifications.

 
        (vii)   Upon execution by both parties of a COA, Zebra shall issue an RCN to reflect any rework charge and any changes to delivery dates, and shall issue such update to the Specifications as necessary to implement changes required by the respective COA. In the event that such change results from a problem as described in Section 3.3, then Manufacturer must provide the impact analysis required by this Section 3.12 to Zebra as soon as possible, but not later than two (2) Business Days after such problem arises.

 
        (viii)  Manufacturer shall invoice Zebra for all costs of Unique Tooling and any rework costs for WIP or finished Products that are approved by Zebra and required to implement a COA.

 
        (ix)    For the avoidance of doubt, any change in manufacturing location (e.g., facility or production line within a facility) shall be deemed an engineering change that requires approval of a COR prior to implementation.

 
3.13    Subcontractors. Manufacturer shall not subcontract any of its obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate or third party, unless it obtains Zebra’s prior consent, which may be withheld in Zebra’s sole discretion. In the event that Manufacturer does subcontract any of its obligations under this Agreement, then the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to all such subcontractors, and Manufacturer shall continue to be liable for performance of its obligations under this Agreement, as well as for the performance of its subcontractors. For purposes of clarification, it shall not be considered subcontracting for Manufacturer to purchase Materials from the vendors on the Approved Vendor List.

 
3.14    Samples and Inspections. To enable Zebra to verify that Products are being manufactured in strict conformity with Specifications, Manufacturer shall provide the samples and permit the inspections set forth below.

a. Samples. Manufacturer shall, upon Zebra’s request, send to Zebra such samples of each Product from Manufacturer’s then most recent production of such Product as the parties shall in good faith agree. Initial samples of a Product shall be provided to Zebra at no charge, and Zebra shall pay for all additional requested samples, other than samples requested in connection with a COA. All Products under this Section 3.14 shall be shipped in accordance with Section 4.5.

b. Inspections. Manufacturer shall allow, and shall cause its vendors to allow, Zebra or its designee the right as reasonably requested (but not less than twice annually, and upon reasonable prior notice (but not greater than three (3) Business Days), to enter the manufacturing and storage facilities (including each Designated Facility and Approved Warehouse) of such Person during regular business hours to inspect and test the Products, WIP, tools, equipment, fixtures, molds and Materials in order to confirm their compliance with the Specifications and compliance with the terms of this Agreement, including performance under Quality Data and key performance indicators. Zebra shall conduct all test and inspections in a manner that avoids unreasonable interference with the operation of such Person’s business. Manufacturer shall make available, and shall cause such vendor to make available, an authorized representative of its organization to facilitate Zebra’s exercise of the foregoing inspection rights. Zebra’s testing and inspection shall not excuse or reduce Manufacturer’s duty to comply with the Specifications or product Warranty set forth in Section 7.2.

 
3.15    Regulatory Audits/Actions. During the Term and thereafter for so long as required by applicable Laws, Manufacturer shall maintain such books, records and data as customary in the industry for electronics manufacturing contractors to maintain on behalf of their customers for purposes of evidencing both the contractor’s and the customer’s compliance with environmental, waste, health, safety, labor, occupational, trade and similar and related Laws, and such other records as reasonably requested by Zebra for compliance with same. In the event that Zebra is the subject of a formal or informal investigation, inspection or request from a governmental agency for records related to Zebra’s and its manufacturer’s compliance with any of the foregoing Laws, Manufacturer shall fully cooperate and render all necessary assistance in assisting Zebra in cooperating with and responding to such investigation, inspection or request, including upon specific request (either directly to Manufacturer or indirectly through Zebra) of the requesting agency by promptly providing such books, records and data to the requesting agency and, if deemed reasonably necessary by both parties in order for Zebra to fully cooperate with such governmental agency, to provide access to such governmental agency to such of Manufacturer’s books, records, data, facilities and personnel as appropriate to enable Zebra and its Affiliates to evidence compliance with such Laws. Such access shall be as requested from time to time, upon reasonable notice to the Manufacturer, at reasonable hours.

 
3.16    No Use of Prohibited Labor. Zebra does not wish to do business with Manufacturers who manufacture or assemble items for sale anywhere in the world using Prohibited Labor, or who fail to satisfy all laws, rules, regulations, codes and standards protecting

4.1     Forecasts. On a weekly basis during the Term, Zebra shall provide Manufacturer with a forecast in the form set forth in Exhibit I (the “Weekly Forecast”) of the quantities of finished Product to be shipped by Manufacturer. The Weekly Forecast will provide expected quantities (a) on a weekly basis for the first five (5) weeks, (b) for the balance of the calendar month in which the fifth week occurs, and (c) for the three (3) calendar month period that follows the calendar month in which the fifth week occurs. Only the first two (2) weeks of the Weekly Forecast shall be binding upon Zebra to purchase such finished Products and Manufacturer to supply such finished Products; the remainder of such forecast is only an estimate for planning and Materials procurement purposes and shall not constitute a commitment to purchase. In addition, each calendar quarter Zebra shall provide a twelve (12) month view of its reasonably anticipated requirements for each Product (the “Quarterly Forecast”), no portion of which shall be binding on either party except for purposes of determining Zebra’s liability for Materials as otherwise stated herein. If such forecast is consistent with the flexibility table set forth in Section 4.2c, Zebra’s forecasts shall be deemed accepted by Manufacturer upon receipt. Manufacturer shall acknowledge each forecast within one (1) Business Day after receipt thereof. If such forecast is not consistent with the flexibility table set forth in Section 4.2c, Manufacturer shall respond with an acceptance or a rejection of such forecast within three (3) Business Days after receipt of such forecast. Manufacturer shall maintain production capacity for each Product based upon Zebra’s forecasts.

 
4.2     Purchase Order and Releases.

a. Open Purchase Order. Concurrently with submission of its first forecast, Zebra shall issue an open purchase order in the form of Zebra’s SDS contract (a form of which is attached hereto in Exhibit I) to Manufacturer for each Product under this Agreement, which purchase order (a) shall remain open for one (1) year, at the end of which year Zebra will issue a new purchase order, (b) is issued solely for purposes of complying with Zebra’s internal account payable procedures for payments to Manufacturer, (c) shall contain the following statement on its face, “This Purchase Order is subject to the Manufacturing Services Agreement, dated May 30, 2007 between Zebra Technologies Corporation and Jabil Circuit, Inc.,” and (d) remains wholly subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

b. Releases. Manufacturer shall ship all Products on a first in, first out (i.e., “FIFO”) basis according to releases provided by Zebra (which Zebra may issue on a daily basis) against its open purchase order. Releases may be on Zebra’s standard form and shall specify the following (each, a “Release”): (i) name of each Product to be released, including model number and/or SKU and revision number (if applicable); (ii) the quantity of each such Product; (iii) shipping arrangements, including delivery destination; and (iv) delivery date. Releases shall be deemed accepted by Manufacturer upon receipt; provided that, Manufacturer shall have the right to reject a Release only if (i) such Release is, either individually, or in the aggregate, when compared against Zebra’s most recent forecast for the applicable period, outside the flexibility table below in Section 4.2c, (ii) the fees

-26-

reflected in the Release are inconsistent with the pricing set forth in Exhibit A, or (iii) such Release would extend Zebra’s credit beyond the credit line extended to Zebra by Manufacturer, which credit line shall not be unreasonably decreased by Manufacturer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Manufacturer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill Releases that exceed the allowable quantity increase (per the flexibility table below in Section 4.2c) over Zebra’s forecast, subject to the availability of Materials. Manufacturer shall notify Zebra of rejection of any such Release as soon as possible, but not later than one (1) Business Day after receipt thereof, unless the Release is rejected pursuant to the foregoing subsection (i), in which case, not later than three (3) Business Days after receipt thereof.

c. Flexibility of Forecasts and Releases. Manufacturer shall provide capacity and upside flexibility for each Product in accordance with the following:

[*** Redacted]

In the chart above, the Maximum Rescheduled Delivery Day indicates the number of days that Zebra may delay delivery of Products without incurring any additional obligation or liability for purchase of such Products. In the event the number of days for rescheduling a delivery day exceeds the parameters set forth above, with respect to the Products and Materials affected, Zebra at its option shall either purchase such Products and/or Unique Materials from Manufacturer or pay to Manufacturer storage charges for such Products and/or Unique Materials at rate equal to [*** Redacted] per month times the cost to purchase such Products and/or Unique Materials at the respective applicable cost set forth in Section 4.3a, 4.3b or 4.3c. The parties shall review on a quarterly basis Manufacturer’s capacity for Products.

d. Minimum Order Requirements. The parties shall agree on the minimum order quantities and minimum shipment quantities for Products.

Accordingly, neither this Agreement, nor any license granted to Manufacturer hereunder, may be assigned or otherwise transferred, including by Change of Control, by Manufacturer without Zebra’s prior written consent. Any attempted assignment or transfer by Manufacturer of its rights or obligations under this Agreement shall be void and of no affect, unless the prior written consent of Zebra has been obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Manufacturer shall have the right to assign its rights to receive monies hereunder without the prior consent of Zebra. Zebra may assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement (and all rights and licenses hereunder): (i) pursuant to a Change of Control; (ii) to an Affiliate; or (iii) otherwise to a third party with the prior consent of Manufacturer.

 
9.2     Successors. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

9.4     Bankruptcy Events. The rights and licenses granted to Zebra under this Agreement are and shall otherwise be deemed to be, for the purposes of Section 365(n) of the United States Bankruptcy Code and similar or related laws in other jurisdictions, a license of “intellectual property” rights as defined in Section 101(35A) of the United States Bankruptcy Code or under similar or related laws in other jurisdictions.

9.5     Dispute Resolution.

a. Exclusive Procedure. Any Dispute between the parties shall be resolved as provided in this Section 9.5, which shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for the resolution of Disputes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may institute formal proceedings at any time to seek a preliminary injunction or other provisional judicial relief, if in its sole judgment such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage (including as a result of a failure to supply Product) or to preserve the status quo. Despite such action, the parties shall continue to participate in good faith in the procedures specified in this Section 9.5.

The notice and the response shall include a statement of each party’s position, a summary of arguments supporting that position and any supporting documentation. Within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the response by the other party, the Project Team shall meet at a mutually agreeable time and place, and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to attempt to resolve the Dispute.

c. Executives’ Negotiation. If the Project Team is unable to resolve, or does not anticipate resolving, the Dispute within thirty (30) days (or such longer period as the parties may agree) after notice of such Dispute is received by the non-disputing party, then the Dispute shall be referred to executives at Zebra and Manufacturer who have authority to settle the Dispute and who are at a higher level of management than the persons who comprise the Project Team. Such executives shall attempt to resolve the Dispute by good faith negotiation.

d. Formal Proceedings. If the parties’ executives are unable to resolve any Dispute within ten (10) Business Days (or such longer period as the parties may agree) after such Dispute is referred to them, then a party may pursue arbitration in accordance with Section 9.5(e) after providing notice to the other party. Except as provided in Section 9.5a, neither party may bring a formal proceeding relating to any Dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement until the dispute resolution and escalation procedures set forth in this Section 9.5 have been exhausted.

e. Binding Arbitration. In accordance with Section 9.5d and except as permitted by Section 9.5a, any Dispute not resolved by the escalation procedures set forth in this Section 9.5 shall be resolved by binding arbitration, and each party hereby waives any right to institute a court or other dispute resolution proceeding with respect to such Dispute and acknowledges arbitration in accordance with this Section 9.5e as the sole and exclusive means of resolving such Dispute.

The arbitration shall be heard and determined by a panel of three (3) arbitrators, each of whom shall be a disinterested attorney having experience and familiarity with manufacturing and supply arrangements in the thermal on demand printer industry. Each party shall choose one (1) arbitrator, with the third arbitrator chosen by agreement of the two (2) arbitrators chosen by the parties. In the event the two (2) arbitrators chosen by the parties cannot agree on a third arbitrator, such third arbitrator shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrators shall decide all disputes primarily based on the terms of this Agreement and secondarily on the laws of the State of Illinois, United States of America

The arbitration proceeding shall occur in Chicago, Illinois, and be conducted in the English language, each party shall bear its own costs relating to such arbitration, the parties shall equally share the arbitrators’ fees and expenses, and the arbitration and all related proceedings and discovery shall take place pursuant to a protective order entered by the arbitrators that adequately protects the confidential nature of each party’s Confidential Information. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitration proceeding shall commence not later than thirty (30) days after a party provides notice of arbitration, shall not continue for longer than thirty (30) days and the arbitrators shall issue their decision within fifteen (15) Business Days after the conclusion of the proceeding.

f. Continued Performance. Each party shall have an unconditional and absolute obligation to continue to perform its obligations under this Agreement during the pendency of efforts to resolve any Dispute unless and until such obligations are terminated by this Agreement or prohibited by order of the arbitrators or a court of competent jurisdiction (as permitted by Section 9.5a).

Manufacturer further agrees that it will notify Zebra before any of its directors, officers, employees or owners becomes in the future a government official, an official of a political party, or candidate for political office, so that Zebra can implement any precautions that it deems necessary to maintain compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition to the foregoing, neither Manufacturer nor any of its personnel shall make any payment (including any offer to pay, promise to pay or gift of money or anything else of value) to any Zebra employee in connection with the solicitation or award of this Agreement or any SOW.

provided that, Manufacturer shall not be excused from any of its obligations unless Manufacturer has complied with all procedures in connection with its business continuity plan pursuant to Section 3.3c, and then only for such period of time as is reasonable to resume the Services under the business continuity plan. In the event that either party is unable to perform its respective obligations, covenants and promises under this Agreement, in whole or in part, due to circumstances of Force Majeure, such party shall give the other party prompt notice of such circumstances and shall exercise every reasonable means to remove or alleviate such impediments to its performance as soon as possible. Subject to the provisions of Section 9.13b, performance under the terms of this Agreement shall be suspended only to the extent and only for such time as the Force Majeure persists and shall resume as soon as practicable after the Force Majeure has abated. In the event that a party’s obligations hereunder are suspended due to a Force Majeure event, then the other party’s obligations shall also be suspended for a corresponding period of time. Regardless of the excuse of Force Majeure, if a party is unable to perform within sixty (60) days after such event, then the other party may terminate this Agreement upon notice.

b. Supply Preference. In the event of a shortage of manufacturing capacity, or any Materials for a Product, as a result of a Force Majeure event, Manufacturer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill from such limited manufacturing capacity and/or supply of Materials or other facilities a proportional share of Zebra’s Weekly forecast for Products, such share to be based upon the volume of Zebra’s unfulfilled Weekly forecast for Products as compared to the outstanding orders of Manufacturer’s other customers (or its or its Affiliates’ internal needs) for products that also depend upon such manufacturing capacity or incorporate such Materials.

 
9.14    Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 
9.15    Construction. This Agreement is executed in the English language and shall be deemed to comprise the language mutually chosen by the parties. This Agreement is governed by the English language and, if any translations are prepared of this Agreement and there is any conflict between the English version and such translation, the English version shall control. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the singular shall include the plural and vice versa, and the terms “include” and “including” shall be deemed to be immediately followed by the phrase “without limitation.” The terms “herein” and “hereunder” and similar terms shall be interpreted to refer to this entire Agreement. The captions and headings in this Agreement are inserted for convenience and reference only and in no way define or limit the scope or content of this Agreement and shall not affect the interpretation of its provisions.

No representative of Zebra or Manufacturer is authorized to make any representation, warranty or promise not contained in this Agreement, except as provided by the next succeeding sentence. For purposes of clarity, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall supersede and control any conflicting terms and conditions in any form of Release, SOW, COR/COA or any other business forms used by the parties for the purposes of ordering, acknowledging, invoicing or shipping, unless such business form is signed by authorized representatives of both parties and specifically references this Agreement and the provision(s) that is superseded.

 
9.19    No Amendment; Waiver. No change, amendment, termination, waiver or other modification of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be binding on either party unless in writing and signed by an officer of each party who is authorized to take such action. No change, amendment, termination, waiver or other modification of this Agreement (including the expiration hereof) shall affect the rights of either party to enforce any claim which was incurred prior to the date of such modification.
